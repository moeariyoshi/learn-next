# Next JS

## Key Features:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: In addition to SSR, Next.js supports static site generation. This means that some or all pages can be generated at build time, resulting in static HTML files.

- **File System Routing**: Next.js uses a file system-based routing system. Pages are automatically associated with routes based on their file structure. For example, a file in the pages directory named `about.js` will create a route `/about`.

- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller chunks, so only the necessary code is loaded when a user accesses a specific page.

- **API Routes**: You can create API routes easily with Next.js. These are serverless functions that can handle backend logic without the need for a separate server.
